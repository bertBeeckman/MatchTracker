MatchTracker
============

What is MatchTracker?
---------------------
MachTracker is an online competition creator and match tracker tool created by 3 ICT students during the course Projecten2 at [KAHO Sint-Lieven](http://www.kaho.be).

Installation
-----------
Since we use the [Symfony Framework](http://symfony.com), you need at least PHP version 5.3.

To use MatchTracker, just clone the repository to your local webserver and make a new `/app/config/parameters.yml` file that corresponds to your db settings or just run the config wizard at `/web/config.php`, resolve any issues that occur, and then choose "Configure your Symfony Application online" to configure your database settings.
